Traditional towns in Portugal and Brazil have evolved a finely tuned
coordination between, on the one hand, modular dimensions for street
widths and lot sizes, and on the other, a typology of room shapes and
layouts within houses. Despite being well documented in urban history,
this coordination was in the last century often interpreted as
contingent, a result of the limited material means of pre-industrial
societies. But the continued application and gradual adaptation of these
urban and architectural patterns through periods of industrialization
and economic development suggests that they respond both to enduring
housing requirements and to piecemeal urban growth. This article surveys
the persistence of urban and architectural patterns up to the early 20th
century, showing their resilience in addressing modern housing and
urbanization requirements.
